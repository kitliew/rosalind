# Problem
# A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as long as possible; in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".
#
# Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".
#
# Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.
#
# Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
#
# Sample Dataset
# >Rosalind_1
# GATTACA
# >Rosalind_2
# TAGACCA
# >Rosalind_3
# ATACA
# Sample Output
# AC
